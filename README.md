# SOUL-Music

## Introduction
Music plays a significant role in today's day to day life. One goes for music when idle, working or even while doing casual errands. Keeping these visions of music in mind we are designing a web based music player application "SOUL MUSIC".
Most music players or applications do not provide the lyrics along with the song. Our objective for creating this music application is to reduce the hardship faced by listeners while searching  for the lyrics and hence provide lyrics along with the song playing simultaneously. It also facilitates video/audio streaming.
It is user-friendly. No formal knowledge is needed for the user to use this application.

## Existing system
We have seen many web apps related to music and all applications have very narrow functionality. Some shows music, some shows only videos and very few of them focuses on lyrics. For all this we have to have two to three different web apps. 
The major existing app is YouTube that only shows video, Sometimes it shows lyrics as captions that does not have good appearance on user as it does not look appealing and good. 
Other major existing apps that plays audio are yt music, apple music, jiosaavn, wink. None of these player supports playing of offline music. 
To sort all of these problems we have introduced the web app with all music player feature. It has audio playing section, video playing section and lyrics section also. 

## Use of the project 
The 'SOUL music' project can be used for many essential features and user friendly environment as:- 
1. Registration and Login Authentication
This step helps to build a strong community and to provide a highly personalized experience for the user. By this, they can suggest their music categories.

2. Discovery (browsing)
Advanced search is one of the most demanded features. So, here the user can search not only by the song name or artist but also by mood, genre, remixes, etc.

3. Navigation
Clear navigation and interface, means the user can feel comfortable to intuitively navigate through these app.

4. Music Categorization
Users feel flexibility to search the tracks and artists. For a smooth experience, categorization by playlists, genres, popularity, other ratings, year of recording, mood, activities, etc. are provided.

4. Music Collections
Many collections of songs will provided so that the user can search their own music collection easily. 

5. Sharing options
A sharing option is provided so that user can share the song with their friends and loved ones.

6. Lyrics
Now a days, the user want not only to listen the music but also to read the lyrics to understand or to learn the song. So these app will provide the lyrics for all the songs that user wants to listen.

7. Video
Sometimes, the user want to see the videos of the song so they can see it in the video section of the song

## Feasibility of project
Most of the music consumption in the 21st century is based on recommendation systems. 
So here we have a lot of things like users are able to see the music with lyrics. And if users want to see the videos of that particular song,they can easily shift to the video part.
Here we divide different sections for user so they find songs according to their choice like most of the people who don't know how to use music player, 
So for them we put pictures which define the variety of songs which help them to enjoy the track easily according to their mood.  
Few factor are there which shows our project are feasible like :-
-The fluidity of language barriers between the users of the "SOUL MUSIC" is English ,Hindi and also it can be easily accessed by virtual assistants.
-There is an economical feasibility like users are able to access it free of cost.
-Operational feasibility like user interface are easy to use.
-Gesture and recommandation is there because technical feasibility  plays one of the important roles for user comfort.
-Most important thing is that we use the latest technology for better response which helps us to use it in an easy way.

## Future scope
Although technology moves at a fast clip, the leaps and bounds in the evolution of digital music player applications to date have been especially speedy and has been embraced by consumers as well. 
The music in future may also respond to the bodies, mood. For instance, using wearable technologies, devices/players will recognize the state of mind and play the track complementing the moment. There have been studies looking at how AI has the ability to generate song lyrics, while AI is also being used to make completely unique music. 
With respect to our “ SOUL MUSIC “ application, in future we can see to include multiple music/video formats along with integrating photos. We can also facilitate our application with loaded content such as audio files, audiobooks etc which can be preloaded onto a device via a subscription service. We can also include wearable digital players that will play the track according to the user’s state of mind.
